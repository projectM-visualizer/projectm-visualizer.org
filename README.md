## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- `bun install` may fail on Windows due to missing `node-gyp`. This is caused by `better-sqlite3`.
  - To fix this, you can run `npm install` followed by `bun install` to install the dependencies.
  - This will then allow you to utilize the environment without issues.
  - Linux has no issues with this.
