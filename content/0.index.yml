  title: About Us
  summary:
    - ProjectM is an open-source, cross-platform music visualization software library designed to replicate the behavior and aesthetic of the well-known MilkDrop plugin originally developed for Winamp by Ryan Geiss. MilkDrop was notable for allowing user-created visualization scripts or “presets,” which generated real-time, beat-synced visual effects based on audio input.
    - To offer MilkDrop-style visualizations on non-Windows systems and in open-source environments, projectM was initiated in 2003 and released in 2004 under the LGPL v2.1 license. Its core component is libprojectM, a C++ library that renders visualizations by processing audio signals using FFT and other techniques, and applies MilkDrop-compatible scripts to generate graphics using OpenGL.
