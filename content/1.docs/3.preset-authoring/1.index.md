## A Comprehensive Guide to Authoring Milkdrop Presets

This section contains all information required to create new and edit existing Milkdrop presets.

Starting with a general overview on the file format and general rendering process, the guide also covers each built-in
effect, syntax and usage of the Milkdrop-specific expressions and making use of HLSL shaders to further improve the
resulting visuals.

### Available Editors

The original Milkdrop plug-in for WinAmp<span>&reg;</span> has a built-in editor which allows editing all parameters
and code blocks. While not being overly user-friendly, it is the editor which was used to create basically all presets
available in the wild.

Recently, more community projects have started implementing their own, improved editors, including projectM. As of now,
none of these editors are released publicly. Once they become available, we'll add links here.
