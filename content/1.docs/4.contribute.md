## Contributing to the Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Our documentation is powered by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/), which allows you to write Markdown files with Vue components, frontmatter, and powerful features built in.

Whether you're fixing a typo, improving explanations, or adding entirely new pages — your help is appreciated!

### Where to Find the Docs

All documentation lives in the `content/1.docs` directory of this repository:
```
project-root/
├── content/
│ ├── 1.docs/
│ │ ├── 1.user/
│ │ ├── 2.developer/
│ │ ├── contribute.md ← you're here!
│ │ └── ...
```
Each Markdown file represents a page in the site.

### How to Make Changes

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Install dependencies, if you haven't already:
```bash
bun install
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
bun dev
```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and preview your changes in real-time.
5. Make your edits inside the appropriate `.md` file in the `content/1.docs` directory.

## Writing Style & Guidelines

- Use clear and concise language.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullet points where appropriate.
- Use semantic Markdown (##, -, **bold**, etc.).
- Add frontmatter (title, description) to each page.
- You can embed components if needed.

## Embedding Components

Markdown files in this project support embedding Vue components directly, allowing you to combine static content with interactive UI elements.

For example, to include a button that links to StackBlitz, you can use the following syntax:

```
::u-button
---
class: mr-4
icon: i-simple-icons-stackblitz
label: Play on StackBlitz
target: _blank
to: https://stackblitz.com/github/projectm-visualizer/projectm-visualizer.org
---
```

Comprehensive documentation for available components is available at [Nuxt UI](https://ui4.nuxt.com/docs/).

If you need to embed custom components, place them in the app/components directory. Components are referenced by their relative file path (excluding the .vue extension), with components/ treated as the root. For example, a component located at components/content/MenuLinkCard.vue would be used as:

```
::content-menu-link-card
---
---
```

## Assets

You can add images and other assets to the `public/content` directory. Reference them in your Markdown files using absolute paths starting with `/`. For example, an image located at `public/content/example.jpg` can be included as:

```
![Example Image](/content/example.jpg)
```

![Example Image](/content/example.jpg)
