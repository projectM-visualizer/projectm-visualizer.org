# 🙌 Contributing to the Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Our documentation is powered by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/), which allows you to write Markdown files with Vue components, frontmatter, and powerful features built in.

Whether you're fixing a typo, improving explanations, or adding entirely new pages — your help is appreciated!

## 🗂 Where to Find the Docs

All documentation lives in the `content/1.docs` directory of this repository:
```
project-root/
├── content/
│ ├── 1.docs/
│ │ ├── 1.user/
│ │ ├── 2.developer/
│ │ ├── contribute.md ← you're here!
│ │ └── ...
```
Each Markdown file represents a page in the site.

# ✍️ Writing Style & Guidelines

- Use clear and concise language.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullet points where appropriate.
- Use semantic Markdown (##, -, **bold**, etc.).
- Add frontmatter (title, description) to each page.
- You can embed components if needed. Example:
```
::u-button
